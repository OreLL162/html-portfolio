<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Orel, a Computer Science student in Holon, Israel.</p>

<p>I have a deep passion for technology and the incredible possibilities it holds.
   Being a Computer Science student allows me to explore this fascinating field and dive into the realm of algorithms, programming languages, and problem-solving. 
   I am constantly learning and expanding my knowledge to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving industry.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of coding and debugging, you can find me hitting the gym. Physical fitness is a priority in my life, and I love pushing myself to new limits.
   The gym is not just a place for me to stay in shape; it's also a great stress reliever and a source of personal growth.</p>

<p>Apart from my academic and fitness pursuits, I am a huge fan of Rap music. The power of words, the rhythm of the beats, and the storytelling within each song captivate me. Rap music allows me to express myself,
  relate to different experiences, and appreciate the artistry behind the lyrics.</p>

<p>In my free time, I also enjoy socializing and spending quality time with my friends. Whether it's going out for a coffee, exploring new places, or simply having meaningful conversations, the company of good friends brings me joy and enriches my life.</p>

<p>ooking ahead, my primary focus is to accomplish my goals in the field of Computer Science. I aspire to make meaningful contributions and play a part in shaping the future of technology. Alongside my professional aspirations, I also have a strong desire to build a loving and supportive family. I believe that a solid foundation of love, trust, and understanding is the key to a fulfilling and harmonious family life.</p>
